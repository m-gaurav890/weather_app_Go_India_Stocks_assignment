A new Flutter project is an assignment named Weather Application by Go India Stocks.

## Getting Started

This Flutter weather app enables users to effortlessly find and view current weather details for different cities. It presents temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather descriptions using intuitive icons. The app provides random city suggestions for exploration and features a refresh button for instant weather updates. With a seamless loading screen during data retrieval, users experience smooth performance. Powered by the OpenWeatherMap API, the app delivers precise weather information in a visually appealing interface, enhanced with gradient backgrounds and stylish design elements.
